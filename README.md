# Deep Learning From Scratch

There are six snippets of code that made deep learning what it is today. [Coding the History of Deep Learning on Floydhub'
s blog](http://blog.floydhub.com/coding-the-history-of-deep-learning/) covers the inventors and the background to their breakthroughs. In this repo, you can find all the code samples from the story.

- **The Method of Least Squares**: The first cost function
- **Gradient Descent**: Finding the minimum of the cost function
- **Linear Regression**: Automatically decrease the cost function
- **The Perceptron**: Using a linear regression type equations to mimic a neuron
- **Artificial Neural Networks**: Leveraging backpropagation to solve non-linear problems
- **Deep Neural Networks**: Neural networks with more than one hidden layer
