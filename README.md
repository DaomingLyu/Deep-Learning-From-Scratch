# Deep Learning From Scratch

- **The Method of Least Squares**: The first cost function
- **Gradient Descent**: Finding the minimum of the cost function
- **Linear Regression**: Automatically decrease the cost function
- **The Perceptron**: Using a linear regression type equations to mimic a neuron
- **Artificial Neural Networks**: Leveraging backpropagation to solve non-linear problems
- **Deep Neural Networks**: Neural networks with more than one hidden layer
